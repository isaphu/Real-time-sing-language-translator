Real-time Sign Language Translator — Terms and Conditions

Last updated: [2025-08-16]

Welcome to Real-time Sign Language Translator. By using this application (the “App”) you agree to these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

1. Who I Am

I am the developer and operator of Real-time Sign Language Translator. Contact: iip2@student.london.ac.uk

2. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the App you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and any documents they incorporate by reference.

3. Purpose of the App

Real-time Sign Language Translator is a communication aid that translates sign language and spoken language to help interactions between Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) users and hearing staff in public service settings. It is an assistive tool and not a substitute for professional human interpreters.

4. User Responsibilities

You agree to use the App lawfully and respectfully. You are responsible for:
• Providing accurate information where required.
• Ensuring any use of the App complies with local policies at the service location (e.g., libraries, government offices).
• Not using the App for illegal, harmful, or abusive purposes.

5. Consent to Capture and Processing

The App requires access to your device camera and/or microphone to perform translations. By activating Real-time Sign Language Translator you explicitly consent to the capture and real-time processing of audio and video for the purpose of providing translation services.

6. Data, Storage & Privacy

I handle personal data in accordance with the App’s Privacy Policy. In summary:
• Video and audio captured for real-time translation are processed to provide the service.
• Unless you explicitly opt into recording or storage, captured media is processed transiently and not retained.
• If recordings or logs are retained (for debugging, training, or improvement) I will request explicit consent and provide controls to view, download, or delete that data.
• All stored data is protected with reasonable security measures, but no system is 100% secure. See the Privacy Policy for details.

7. Accuracy, Limitations & Expectations

Translation accuracy may vary due to lighting, camera angle, occlusion, signer variability, dialects, and other real-world factors. I do not guarantee perfect or complete translations. Real-time Sign Language Translator is intended to assist communication; critical decisions (medical, legal, emergency) should not rely solely on automated translation.

8. Intellectual Property

All intellectual property in the App (software, UI, documentation) is owned by me or my licensors. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works without my prior written permission.

9. Prohibited Conduct

You must not:
• Attempt to reverse engineer or interfere with the App.
• Use the App to infringe others’ rights or for discriminatory, harassing, or illegal activities.
• Circumvent privacy controls or share others’ recorded material without consent.

10. Support, Updates & Availability

I may provide updates, bug fixes, or feature changes at my discretion. I do not guarantee continuous availability; maintenance windows or outages may occur.

11. Warranty Disclaimer

To the fullest extent permitted by law, I provide the App “as is” and disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

12. Limitation of Liability

Except where prohibited by law, I am not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to lost data, lost profits, or failure to communicate in critical circumstances.

13. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold me harmless from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising out of your use of the App or violation of these Terms.

14. Termination

I may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time for violations of these Terms or for operational reasons. On termination, your right to use the App ends but clauses intended to survive (e.g., liability, indemnity, IP) remain in force.

15. Changes to These Terms

I may update these Terms from time to time. When changes are material I will make reasonable efforts to notify users. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance.

16. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the laws of Australia. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales.

17. Contact
